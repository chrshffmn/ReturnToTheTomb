## Description
“Return to the Tomb” is a prototype virtual reality (VR) experience that combines a 3D reconstruction model of the ancient Egyptian necropolis of Saqqara with a photogrammetric model of the Late Period basalt inner sarcophagus of Psamtek, “chief physician” and “overseer of the Temehu (Libyan mercenaries)”. 

Directed by Dr. Rita Lucarelli (UC Berkeley) and Dr. Elaine Sullivan (UC Santa Cruz), the project team included staff and student technologists at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. Development of this version of the experience began in 2019 and ended in 2020 and was funded by a seed grant from the CITRIS and the Banatao Institute of the University of California.

The experience was built using Unity version 2018.3.14f1 for the HTC Vive headset. It has been demonstrated to run on HTC Vive, HTC Cosmos, and Meta Quest 2 headsets. See System Requirements below. The contents of this repository include only the compiled application from August 2020. If you are interested in the actual code and assets, please contact the authors.

Next Steps: Dr. Lucarelli and Dr. Sullivan are designing a new version of Return to the Tomb which will include more details about the tomb of Psamtek as well as other tombs from Saqqara. For that effort, they are pleased to welcome Dr. Matthias Lang (Universität Bonn) and Dr. Eiman Elgewely (Virginia Tech) to the team.

## System Requirements
This version of the Return to the Tomb VR experience was developed using Unity version 2018.3.14f1 for the HTC Vive headset using Steam VR. It has also run successfully on the HTC Cosmos headset. These HTC configurations require a tethered connection to a VR-ready Windows PC. The experience also runs on the Meta Quest 2 headset using the Quest Link system to connect the headset to a VR-ready Windows PC (see this [Meta document](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/140991407990979/) for cable and PC requirements including the NVIDIA and AMD GPU cards that are compatible with Quest Link).

### Download repository from GitHub
Download this GitHub repository. In most cases, this will involve downloading a zip file of the entire repository using the "Code" button. See instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives). However, because some of the content in this repository is large, you may need to download subsets and then reassemble the contents to match the file structure in the repository. Note that the downloaded zip file will require nearly 170MB of disk space, and when unzipped, the contents will require 670MB of disk space.

To run this experience you will need the following:
### For HTC Vive and HTC Cosmos headsets
* VR-ready Windows PC with the assets in this repository stored locally
* Steam VR application and account
* With the HTC headset connected to the VR-ready Windows PC, open the folder and double-click the executable file “The Doctor.exe”. 

### For Meta Quest 2 headset
* VR-ready Windows PC with the assets in this repository stored locally
* Steam VR application and account
* Quest Link cable with successful connection to the VR-ready Windows PC ([cable and PC requirements](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/140991407990979/); [setup instructions](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/509273027107091/)). This requires a Meta account.
* With the Meta Quest 2 headset connected to the VR-ready Windows PC and Quest Link working correctly, open the folder and double-click the executable file “The Doctor.exe”.
